# Arduino RC Obstacle-Avoiding Car

This is an Arduino-powered obstacle-avoiding robot car designed as a personal engineering project to develop and showcase hands-on skills in electronics, programming, and embedded system design. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and autonomously navigate around them using a motor driver and two DC motors.

## Features

- Autonomous obstacle avoidance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor  
- Motor control via L298N H-Bridge driver  
- Powered by Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- Adjustable detection range via code  
- Expandable with features like Bluetooth, line-following, or app control
